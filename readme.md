- In server.js, can't figure out how to upsert so that only new titles are added to the database (see line 54)
- Have the ability to update saved to true, but can't figure out how to display /saved as a page.
  - server returns the db data, so it can't also route to /saved.html, it seems like I can do one or the other but not both.
  - See line 102 of server.js
